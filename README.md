This project kind of became a rabbit hole with a lot of folders. Navigate into the my-basic-website folder, then the backend folder. All code should be executed from there

The following packages are required: 
express==4.18.3

Simply run "npm install express" or "npm install express@4.18.3" for the specific version

To run the program run "node index.js" once in the backend folder
